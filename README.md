# GitHub Project File/Folder Browser

This project will browse files and folders of a GitHub project (repo) in the browser.

## Getting Started

1. Copy your sample `index.html` into this folder: `C:\Users\NEC VM-7\CascadeProjects\gh-file-browser\index.html`.
2. Open the file in your browser to test.
3. We will iterate to add features:
   - Browse directories and files from a GitHub repo
   - View file contents (render text/markdown)
   - Basic navigation (breadcrumbs, back/forward)
   - Optional: search, raw download, caching

## Notes

- Keep your GitHub repo public or provide an API token for private repos (we will add a secure input if needed).
- If using GitHub REST API, be mindful of rate limits.
